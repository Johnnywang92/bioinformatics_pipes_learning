### objectives:

1. 了解单细胞测序背后motivation
2. 学习单细胞转录组数据的收集、处理、分析过程中使用到的工具和步骤
3. 分析数据和interpret 结果
4. 学习单细胞测序技术的未来发展方向

## 1. Concepts in scRNA-seq and main applications

what is RNA sequencing?

    RNA sequencing is the 'reading' of the RNA  molecules present in the cell. we can observe where these molecules comes from(genes) ; how many there are(gene expression) and what they look like(variants , RNA processing)



The much -needed study of individual cells:

    within a tissue there are multiple types of cells; each cell has a unique transcriptomic fingerprint; Only certain cells may react to a treatment/condition -> the signal from these cells may be hindered if studied in bulk

Applications:

    Study and identify cellular heterogeneity -> cell populations within a tissue.

    Discover new cell types.

    Discover new markwes and regulatory pathways.

    Reconstruct cellular lineage.


A bit of history:


## 2. Important issues in experimental Design


Doublet: when two cells are lysed and sequenced within the same droplet.

Amplification and sequencing:

    the amount of RNA required for successful signal dection is 0.1~1.0 ug

    the amount of RNA present in a single cell is 1-50pg (2000 to 1 million times less)

    Not all RNA molecules are captured. Droplet based technologies capture only around 5-8% of RNAs

    only around 5% of RNAs are mRNAs

    the most-commonly used methods for amplication are: PCR; IVT( In-vitro transcription)

    

   Sequencing is performed on all the RNAs from all the cells together(multiplexing).

   Each molecule contains labels to indicate their origin(which cell) called barcodes.

## 3. Comparison between popular technical platforms

SmartSeq2 protocol:

PROS: 
* Full length detection of transcript

CONS:
* No barcode=cells are isolated first and then sequenced individually;
* Not multiplexed= alibrary preparation for individual cells;
* No UMI= the protocol does not implement UMI; very expensive

## 4. Raw data processing:

单细胞转录组测序数据分析通常包括以下主要步骤:

1. 质控(QC)

- 去除低质量的细胞和基因
- 过滤掉双t、三t数组等质控不合格的reads

2. 预处理

- 去除构建文库过程中的batch effect
- 对UMI进行去重处理
- 对reads数进行归一化

3. 特征选择

- 过滤低表达的基因
- 选择高变异的特征基因

4. 降维和可视化

- 使用PCA、t-SNE等技术进行降维
- 可视化 Expression Pattern

5. 聚类

- 对细胞进行无监督的Graph聚类
- 确定细胞类别

6. Differential Expression分析

- 找到不同细胞亚群间差异表达的基因

7. 细胞trajectory分析

- 探究细胞分化或状态转化的规律

8. 标记基因分析

- 验证不同细胞群的特异性标记基因

按照这一流程,可以从单细胞测序数据中挖掘细胞异质性信息,建立数据分析流水线。但需要根据具体科学问题,选择合适的方法。
